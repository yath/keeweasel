What is Keeweasel?
==================

Keeweasel is a Perl script to synchronize passwords between Firefox/Iceweasel
and KeePassX. The idea is to put the KeePassX database somewhere into the
Cloudâ„¢ and have your passwords synchronized everywhere, even on your Android
phone.


Installation
============

    Linux
    -----
    You will need a working C compiler, the development packages for libnss3 and
    libnspr4 and the Perl modules Inline::C and File::KeePass. For Debian
    systems:
      # apt-get install libnss3-dev libnspr4-dev libinline-perl dh-make-perl
      # dh-make-perl --install --cpan File::KeePass

    Windows
    -------
    You will also need a working C compiler and Inline::C and File::KeePass,
    you don't need the NSS and NSPR headers though. The easiest way to get
    Keeweasel running is:
      - Grab a cup of tea. The installation will take a couple of minutes.
      - Install Strawberry Perl from http://strawberryperl.com/ - this also
        includes a C compiler. If the installer crashes, just ignore it.
      - Start a CPAN shell by running the command "cpan" inside a cmd window.
      - Type
            force install File::KeePass Inline::C
        into the CPAN shell. Ignore the failed tests of File::KeePass (Keeweasel
        will work around them) and answer the questions asked with the enter key.

Usage
=====

perl keeweasel.pl [arguments]

Arguments are, currently (they are subject to change):

    -p <profile>
        The Firefox profile to use. This can either be the name of a profile
        or a path to a profile directory. If omitted, Keeweasel will try to
        find a default profile (but I would not rely on Keeweasel guessing right).

    -k <keepass database>
        Path to the KeePassX database (i.e. the *.kdb file). This is mandatory.

    -d <default group>
        The name of the group where items new to KeePassX are to be stored. If
        omitted the first group found is used.
